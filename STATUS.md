# MusicAssistantKit - Development Status

## Summary

MusicAssistantKit is a Swift library for interacting with Music Assistant servers. The library is **functional** with working player control, event monitoring, and search capabilities.

## What's Working ✅

### Core Library
- ✅ WebSocket connection management with actor-based thread safety
- ✅ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (1s → 60s max)
- ✅ ServerInfo handshake parsing (supports MA v2.7.0+)
- ✅ Message envelope parsing (commands, results, errors, events)
- ✅ Player control commands (play, pause, stop)
- ✅ Event streaming via Combine publishers
- ✅ AnyCodable wrapper for flexible JSON handling

### CLI Tools
- ✅ **ma-control**: Player control (play/pause/stop) - **VERIFIED WORKING**
- ✅ **ma-monitor**: Real-time event monitoring - **VERIFIED WORKING** (connects successfully)
- ⚠️ **ma-search**: Library search - **NEEDS TESTING** (server connection issue during testing)

## Recent Fixes

1. **ServerInfo Decoding** - Added missing fields (`base_url`, `onboard_done`) that MA v2.7.0 sends
2. **Event Data Type** - Changed from `[String: AnyCodable]?` to `AnyCodable?` to handle numeric event data
3. **JSON Decoding Strategy** - Removed `.convertFromSnakeCase` since we use explicit CodingKeys
4. **Message Handler Race Condition** - Ensured handler is set before connection
5. **Search API** - Corrected command from `search` to `music/search` and parameter from `query` to `search`

## Known Issues

### Server Connection
- During testing, the Music Assistant server at `192.168.23.196:8095` started refusing connections
- This appears to be temporary (possibly rate-limiting after rapid reconnection attempts)
- **Action needed**: Verify server is running, restart if necessary

### Search Command (Untested)
- The search API endpoint and parameters have been corrected
- Not yet verified against live server due to connection issue above
- Should work once server connection is restored

## Testing Performed

### Successful Tests
```bash
# Player control - PASSED
.build/debug/ma-control media_player.office play
# Output: Connected, sent play command, disconnected cleanly

# Event monitoring - PASSED
.build/debug/ma-monitor media_player.office
# Output: Connected, ready to receive events (no reconnection loops)
```

### Pending Tests
```bash
# Search - NEEDS RETRY
.build/debug/ma-search "Queen"
# Expected: Display tracks, albums, artists matching "Queen"
# Status: Connection refused (server issue, not library issue)
```

## Architecture

### Message Flow
1. Client creates WebSocket connection
2. Server sends ServerInfo banner
3. Client starts receive loop
4. Client sets message handler
5. Commands sent with unique message IDs
6. Responses correlated via CheckedContinuation
7. Events published to Combine subjects

### Key Components
- `MusicAssistantClient` (actor): Main API, command execution, event publishing
- `WebSocketConnection` (actor): Low-level WebSocket management
- `EventPublisher`: Combine-based event routing
- `AnyCodable`: Flexible JSON value wrapper

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Verify Music Assistant server connectivity
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.23.196:8095/
   ```

2. **Test search**: Once server is accessible, verify search functionality
   ```bash
   .build/debug/ma-search "Beatles"
   ```

3. **Test with events**: Play music and verify ma-monitor shows updates
   ```bash
   .build/debug/ma-monitor media_player.kitchen &
   .build/debug/ma-control media_player.kitchen play
   # Should see player state changes in monitor output
   ```

4. **Production readiness**:
   - Add comprehensive error messages
   - Add logging framework (instead of print statements)
   - Add unit tests for message parsing
   - Add integration tests against test server
   - Document all public APIs
   - Add usage examples to README

## Configuration

Default server: `192.168.23.196:8095`

All CLI tools accept `--host` and `--port` arguments:
```bash
.build/debug/ma-control --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8095 player_id play
```

## Installation

From project root:
```bash
swift build
# Executables in: .build/debug/ma-*
```

Optional: Copy to PATH
```bash
cp .build/debug/ma-* /usr/local/bin/
```
