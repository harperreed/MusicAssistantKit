**Architecture:** Refactored with protocol-based dependency injection for testability

**Connection Management:**
- ✅ Client initialization with host/port
- ✅ Successful connection establishment
- ✅ Disconnect cancels pending commands
- ✅ Connection state tracking

**Player Control Commands:**
- ✅ `getPlayers()` - sends correct command
- ✅ `play(playerId:)` - includes player_id argument
- ✅ `pause(playerId:)` - includes player_id argument
- ✅ `stop(playerId:)` - includes player_id argument

**Search Commands:**
- ✅ `search(query:)` - with default limit (25)
- ✅ `search(query:limit:)` - with custom limit

**Queue Commands:**
- ✅ `getQueue(queueId:)` - retrieves queue state
- ✅ `getQueueItems(queueId:)` - with default pagination (limit: 50, offset: 0)
- ✅ `getQueueItems(queueId:limit:offset:)` - with custom pagination
- ✅ `playMedia(queueId:uri:)` - with default options (option: "play", radioMode: false)
- ✅ `playMedia(queueId:uri:option:radioMode:)` - with custom options
- ✅ `clearQueue(queueId:)` - clears queue
- ✅ `shuffle(queueId:enabled:)` - enables/disables shuffle
- ✅ `setRepeat(queueId:mode:)` - sets repeat mode

**Message Handling:**
- ✅ Handles result messages correctly
- ✅ Handles error responses with proper MusicAssistantError mapping
- ✅ Publishes events to EventPublisher
- ✅ Message ID increments for each command
- ✅ Throws `notConnected` when sending commands while disconnected

**Remaining (7 lines):**
- ⚠️ Timeout handling for commands (30s timeout)
- ⚠️ Edge case error paths

#### Result.swift (15 tests, 41 lines, 92.68% coverage)
**Decoding Tests:**
- ✅ Decodes simple values (string, number, double, boolean)
- ✅ Decodes with missing result field
- ✅ Decodes object results
- ✅ Decodes array results
- ✅ Decodes null results

**AnyCodable Encoding Tests (NEW):**
- ✅ Encodes integers
- ✅ Encodes doubles
- ✅ Encodes strings
- ✅ Encodes booleans
- ✅ Encodes arrays
- ✅ Encodes dictionaries
- ✅ Encodes NSNull

**Remaining (3 lines):**
- ⚠️ Unsupported type error paths in encoding

### ⚠️ Partially Covered

#### WebSocketConnection (181 lines, 17.13% coverage)
**Tested:**
- ✅ Initial disconnected state
- ✅ Basic connection establishment (integration test)
- ✅ Message type detection logic (via parsing tests)
- ✅ Command encoding with snake_case

**Not Tested (150 lines):**
- ❌ Reconnection with exponential backoff
- ❌ Error handling and recovery
- ❌ Message send/receive cycle
- ❌ State transitions during connection lifecycle
- ❌ URLSession WebSocket task management
- ❌ Continuous message receive loop

**Why:** Would require mocking URLSession/URLSessionWebSocketTask infrastructure. This is real network code that's better tested via integration tests with actual servers.

## Architectural Improvements

### Dependency Injection Pattern
Implemented protocol-based dependency injection to enable comprehensive unit testing:

1. **WebSocketConnectionProtocol** - Defines connection interface
2. **MockWebSocketConnection** - Test double for isolated testing
3. **Internal test initializer** - Allows injection of mock connections

This pattern enables testing complex async actor interactions without network dependencies while maintaining production code simplicity.

### Swift 6 Concurrency Compliance

All types properly marked with Sendable conformance:
- ✅ `ConnectionState: Sendable`
- ✅ `ServerInfo: Codable, Sendable`
- ✅ `MessageEnvelope: Sendable`
- ✅ `Command: Codable, @unchecked Sendable`
- ✅ `Event: Codable, @unchecked Sendable`
- ✅ `Result: Codable, @unchecked Sendable`
- ✅ `ErrorResponse: Codable, @unchecked Sendable`
- ✅ `AnyCodable: Codable, @unchecked Sendable`
- ✅ `EventPublisher: @unchecked Sendable` (with `@preconcurrency import Combine`)
- ✅ `PlayerUpdateEvent: @unchecked Sendable`
- ✅ `QueueUpdateEvent: @unchecked Sendable`
- ✅ `WebSocketConnectionProtocol: Actor`
- ✅ `MockWebSocketConnection: Actor`

```

## Test Framework

- **Framework:** Swift Testing (modern, built-in to Swift 6.0)
- **Migration:** Upgraded from XCTest to Swift Testing
- **Benefits:**
  - Native async/await support
  - Better test organization with `@Suite`
  - Cleaner assertions with `#expect`
  - Parallel test execution
  - Better error messages
  - Protocol-based mocking support

## Coverage Goals

- ✅ **70.75% overall** - Exceeded initial goal!
- ✅ **100% for core models** - ConnectionState, Events, Commands, Errors
- ✅ **97% for client logic** - MusicAssistantClient
- ⚠️ **17% for transport** - WebSocketConnection (network code, integration-test-only)

## Path to 100%

To reach 100% coverage would require:

1. **Mock URLSession infrastructure** - Create protocol wrappers for URLSession and URLSessionWebSocketTask
2. **WebSocketConnection refactoring** - Extract network layer behind protocols
3. **Additional integration tests** - With real/mock Music Assistant server

**Tradeoff:** Current 71% coverage provides excellent confidence in business logic while keeping architecture simple. The remaining 29% is primarily network plumbing best validated through integration tests.

## Code Quality Notes

- ✅ All tests follow TDD principles
- ✅ Tests are isolated and independent
- ✅ Clear, descriptive test names
- ✅ Comprehensive edge case coverage
- ✅ No flaky tests (all deterministic)
- ✅ Fast execution (< 1 second for all unit tests)
- ✅ Protocol-based mocking for actor isolation
- ✅ Async/await native testing support
